# Overview 

### Supplementary Information: Integrative Modelling of Signalling Network Dynamics Identifies Cell Type-selective Therapeutic Strategies for FGFR4-driven Cancers. 
### The numerical simulations were primarily conducted using MATLAB 2024a. However, we believe that MATLAB 2023a/2023b can reliably reproduce the results.

# Reproduction of the simulation results
### We have written codes to easily reproduce the simulation results presented in the manuscript. Users can follow the steps below to run the code.
### 1. Create a local folder (e.g., 'myfold').
### 2. Move the file 'run_simulation.m' and two folders ('project_code', 'project_data') into your local folder.
### 3. Open 'run_simulation.m' in Matlab and run it.
### 4. Follow the instructions as directed by the prompt.
