# Overview 

Supplementary Information: Integrative Modelling of Signalling Network Dynamics Identifies Cell Type-selective Therapeutic Strategies for FGFR4-driven Cancers. Implementation of the numerical simulations described in the present study was carried out using Matlab 2024a. Note. Matlab 2023a or later versions can reliably reproduce the results.

# Reproduction of the simulation results
We have written codes to easily reproduce the simulation results presented in the manuscript. Users can follow the steps below to run the code.
1. Create a local folder (e.g., 'myfold').
2. Move the file 'run_simulation.m' and two folders ('project_code', 'project_data') into your local folder.
3. Open 'run_simulation.m' in Matlab and run it.
4. Follow the instructions as directed by the prompt.
