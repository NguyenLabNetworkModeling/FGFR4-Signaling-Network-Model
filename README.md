# Overview 

Supplementary Information: Integrative Modelling of Signalling Network Dynamics Identifies Cell Type-selective Therapeutic Strategies for FGFR4-driven Cancers.
Implementation of the numerical simulations described in the present study was carried out using Matlab 2022b. 

# Run the model
To initiate the computational simulation, the 'Project_Manager.m' script was executed within the MATLAB environment.
